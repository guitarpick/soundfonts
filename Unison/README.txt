1. Description
=================
Unison is a 28Mb, FREE, high quality soundfont created to improve the quality of
midi playback. In order to be able to enjoy Unison in its full glory you need a
soundfont compatible sound card (SB32/AWE32/AWE64 with 28Mb of on-board memory
or the SBLive! with at least 64Mb of system RAM), some good quality midi files
(which I've included with the ZIP file), or a game that utilizes midi for its
music. You also need a program called SFArk in order to be able to decompress
and use the soundfont. You can get the program at http://www.melodymachine.com

2. Features
=================
- 28Mb GM/GS compatible
- 128 GM melodic presets
-  30 GS melodic variation tones
-  10 Drum kits

3. History
=================
Unison has been in the works for over 8 months before its release. Actually, it
was 8 months before its release that I acquired 28Mb for my old trusty AWE32 and
began optimizing my good old 8Mb GM/GS soundfont for 28Mb of memory (actually,
I've been collecting samples for Unison long before.) Most of the samples used
in the font I collected from the Internet. Almost all of them I converted from
other formats (Kurzweil, Yamaha, Roland, Ensoniq, Akai, Kawai, Oberheim, Gravis
Ultrasound, etc.), re-sampled them, created/recreated loop points, tuned them in,
and added all the other settings that make Unison what it is today.

=================
4. Future Updates
=================
I still see a lot of room for improvement so future updates are certain. As soon
as I get my own SBLive! I plan on expanding Unison to 32Mb. I will use the extra
4Mb for additional GS variation tones and to improve the current batch of
instruments. The font still contains a few instruments/sounds from the EMU's 8Mb
soundfont (Music Box, Jazz Guitar, Brass, Soprano Sax, Solo Vox, and Space Voice)
which I plan on replacing with better ones in the future.

5. Special Thanks
=================
Special thanks go out to Uros Katic for letting me use the Bright Grand Piano
that I got from his wonderful PowerGM soundfont. Actually it was Daniel Carreri
that created it so all the credit for that one goes to him. Also, special thanks
go out to those giving me the words of encouragement and compliments. It makes
work on Unison worth while.
